9.10. You have a stack of n boxes, with widths w_{i}, heights h_{i} and
# depths d_{i}. The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of
# one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above
# it in width, height, and depth. Implement a method to build the tallest stack
# possible, where the height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box.
