Your company built an in-house calendar tool called HiCal.
You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.
e.g. input [(3,6),(2,4),(2,5)]
output should be [(2,6)]
So 2 to 6 time everyone is not FREE.

A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one anotherâ€™s shoulders.
For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible number of peo- ple in such a tower.
EXAMPLE:
Input (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom: (56, 90) (60,95) (65,100) (68,110) (70,150) (75,190)
